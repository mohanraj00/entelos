# Third-party source and notices

Project source uses [Apache-2.0](../LICENSE), with project attribution in [NOTICE](../NOTICE). This does not replace any dependency licence or notice.

This source-only reference does not vendor dependencies or distribute compiled binaries. The Go lockfiles select the runtime closure. The observed upstream license texts are retained below. They keep their own terms.

| Module | Version | Observed license | Retained text |
|---|---|---|---|
| cel.dev/cel-go | v0.32.0 | Apache-2.0 | [license](dependencies/cel.dev__cel-go__LICENSE.txt) |
| cel.dev/expr | v0.25.3 | Apache-2.0 | [license](dependencies/cel.dev__expr__LICENSE.txt) |
| github.com/antlr4-go/antlr/v4 | v4.13.1 | BSD-style; retained license digest identifies exact text | [license](dependencies/github.com__antlr4-go__antlr__v4__LICENSE.txt) |
| go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 | v3.0.4 | MIT and Apache-2.0 by file; see upstream LICENSE | [license](dependencies/go.yaml.in__yaml__v3__LICENSE.txt) |

The author CLI is fetched separately from its pinned public repository, which retains its Apache-2.0 license and dependency notices. Its source and binaries are not in this tree.

The optional approval dashboard uses the mugham UI kit, tag `v0.1.0` (commit `7943c22674d6175bd6ef7f853e464c705ae3ec38`), licence Apache-2.0. The kit has no runtime dependency. `examples/approval-dashboard/run.py` fetches it from its public repository into the work directory and copies its `LICENSE` with it into the served site. Its source is not in this tree.

## CI tools

The [Claude review](../.github/workflows/claude-review.yml) and [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflows each download one tool on the GitHub runner. The tools are not in this tree, and this project does not distribute them.

| Package | Version | Observed license | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| @anthropic-ai/claude-code-linux-x64 | 2.1.319 | Proprietary. The package `LICENSE.md` says "All rights reserved" and points to the Anthropic legal agreements at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance. | The workflow checks the SHA-512 value of the package, then runs the CLI on the runner with the owner's OAuth token. |
| actionlint (rhysd/actionlint, linux_amd64 release archive) | 1.7.7 | MIT. The `LICENSE.txt` of the release archive says "the MIT License", Copyright (c) 2021 rhysd. | The `actionlint` job of the CI workflow checks the SHA-256 value of the archive, then parses each workflow. It gets no secret. |

The Apache-2.0 licence of this project does not apply to this tool. The owner's account agreement with Anthropic controls its use. If a workflow changes the version of a tool, change its row too.

Before distributing any binary, enumerate its actual linked dependencies and retain required license/NOTICE/copyright material. That includes any optional tool binary selected for distribution. A source-only reference is not permission to omit upstream notices from a later binary release.

Python standard-library and system Git are prerequisites, not bundled software. The workflow/schema sources are credited in docs/PROVENANCE.md; provider schemas and native Tekton code are not copied.
