# Wire protocol 1.0

This file defines the versioned wire protocol between an application module and the lifecycle. Issue [#83](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/83) owns it. The [technology decision](../../docs/decisions/0001-technology.md) selected JSON with a JSON Schema, length-prefixed frames on a Unix socket, and RFC 8785 for canonical bytes.

The protocol is unstable. A later milestone states its compatibility.

Version 1.1 is defined in [approval/APPROVAL.md](approval/APPROVAL.md) for issue [#130](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/130). This file defines only 1.0. The Go Host and the sidecar implement 1.0 and 1.1.

## Files

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `schema/envelope.schema.json` | The request envelope, the success and failure responses, and the diagnostic object. |
| `schema/<operation>.schema.json` | One file for each lifecycle operation. `$defs/request_body` is the request body. `$defs/result` is the `result` of a success response. |
| `vectors/session-*.json` | Golden request and response vectors. |
| `vectors/jcs.json` | RFC 8785 canonical form vectors. |
| `vectors/envelope-schema.json` | Valid and invalid values for the envelope definitions. |
| `test_protocol.py` | The vector runner. It runs the session vectors through the socket of the Go sidecar. `verify.py` runs it as the `sidecar-protocol` check. |
| `../lifecycle-core/protocol/` | The Go adapter. `../lifecycle-core/cmd/entelos-sidecar` serves it on a Unix domain socket. |

## Unix socket authentication

On the sidecar socket, prefix **each request frame** with the four ASCII bytes
`ENT1` and the 64 lowercase ASCII hex digits of the operator's token. Send
the frame length and JSON immediately after those 68 bytes, with no newline
or separator. The prelude is outside the frame length. Responses use the
ordinary frame format below.

The sidecar checks the prelude and the current token before reading the frame
length or JSON. A missing or wrong credential gets one `unauthenticated`
response with `request_id` set to `""` and diagnostic stage
`authentication`, then the sidecar closes the connection. The Host receives
no request and writes no record. The first byte must arrive within 30 seconds
of opening a connection. Once a prelude starts, it must finish within 30
seconds. An authenticated connection can stay idle between requests. A clean
EOF between requests ends the stream.

The operator configures and rotates the token with
[`--token-file`](../lifecycle-core/README.md#sidecar). This prelude is required
starting with v0.3.0. Clients written for v0.2.0 must change their request
framing before calling the v0.3.0 sidecar. The JSON messages remain at version 1.0.

## Frame

A frame is a 4-byte unsigned big-endian length `N`, then `N` bytes of UTF-8 JSON.

- `N` must be from 1 to 1048576. If `N` is 0 or more than 1048576, the receiver sends one `invalid_frame` response and closes the connection.
- A read can return fewer bytes than requested. The receiver reads again until it has the full header or payload. Only the end of the stream ends a frame early.
- If the stream ends inside a header or inside a payload, the receiver sends one `invalid_frame` response and closes the connection.
- A write can accept fewer bytes than supplied. The receiver writes again until it has written the full frame.
- A response frame also obeys the bound of 1048576 bytes. If a result is larger than the bound, the receiver sends `response_too_large` in its place.
- One request frame gets one response frame, in the same order.
- The receiver encodes each response in the RFC 8785 canonical form.

## Request

```json
{"protocol":"1.0","request_id":"r-1","operation":"describe","body":{"function":"record.visible","date":"2026-11-15"}}
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `protocol` | `"MAJOR.MINOR"`. |
| `request_id` | A string of 1 to 128 characters. The caller chooses it. The response echoes it. |
| `operation` | The name of one lifecycle operation. |
| `body` | An object. The schema of the operation defines its fields. |

The receiver rejects these payloads with `invalid_request`:

- JSON that is not valid UTF-8, or that is not one object;
- a duplicate key;
- a number that is not an integer, or an integer outside ±(2^53 − 1);
- an unknown top-level field, a missing field or a field of the wrong type;
- a string that does not match its schema pattern.

Each schema `pattern` starts with `^` and ends with `$`. The pattern must match the full string, as in ECMA-262. A trailing newline does not match `$`. For example, `"2026-11-15\n"` and `"1.0\n"` are invalid.

A write operation also needs `expected_revision` and `request_key` in its body. A read operation must not have them. The `x-entelos-access` value in each schema file shows the access type. The host context (actor, roles, scope) never comes from a request.

## Version rule

The receiver checks the version first, before all other fields.

- If `protocol` is missing or does not agree with the pattern, the response is `invalid_request`.
- If the major version is not 1, the response is `unsupported_version`.
- If the minor version is more than 0, the response is `unsupported_version`. A later minor version can add fields, and this receiver rejects unknown fields.

Each response has `"protocol":"1.0"`, which is the version of the receiver.

## Response

A success:

```json
{"protocol":"1.0","request_id":"r-1","status":"ok","result":{}}
```

A failure:

```json
{"protocol":"1.0","request_id":"r-1","status":"out_of_scope","diagnostic":{"code":"out_of_scope","stage":"resolve","message":"no enabled revision for the exact function/scope/date"}}
```

- `status` is `ok` or the diagnostic code.
- `message` has a maximum of 1024 characters. A character is one Unicode code point, as in JSON Schema `maxLength`. The receiver truncates a longer message.
- Each diagnostic must encode as UTF-8. If a message contains a lone surrogate, the receiver writes it as a backslash escape.
- A success always echoes a valid `request_id` of 1 to 128 characters.
- If the receiver cannot read a valid `request_id`, the response has `"request_id":""`.
- A write success has `result` = `{"cursor":…,"result":…,"reused":…}`. `reused` is `true` for an idempotent retry with the same `request_key` and the same payload.

## Diagnostics

`stage` tells where the failure occurred:

| Stage | Source |
|---|---|
| `authentication` | The Unix socket token was missing, invalid or unavailable. The Host did not get the request. |
| `protocol` | The frame, the envelope or the body schema. The Host did not get the request. |
| `authority` | The host roles do not permit the operation. |
| `host` | The Host failed with an unexpected error (`internal_error`). The message has no exception text and no paths. |
| `lifecycle`, `admission`, `resolve`, `runtime`, `store`, `codec` | The Host and the store. The codes are the existing `Fault` codes of the lifecycle core in `src/lifecycle-core`. |

The protocol adds `unauthenticated`, `unsupported_version`, `invalid_frame`, `response_too_large` and `internal_error`. The receiver also sends `internal_error` if a Host result is outside the value domain, for example a float or an object key that is not a string. All other codes are the existing `Fault` codes, for example `invalid_request`, `forbidden`, `out_of_scope`, `invalid_interval`, `stale_revision`, `idempotency_conflict`, `artifact_unavailable`, `activation_expired` and `activation_revoked`.

`message` is text for a person. A program must use `code` and `stage`. The vectors do not compare `message`.

## Vectors

Each `session-*.json` file has a host `context` and ordered `steps`. The runner makes a fresh empty store for each file and runs the steps in order. A step gives one of these inputs:

- `request`: an object. The runner encodes it in the canonical form.
- `payload_text` or `payload_hex`: the exact payload bytes of one frame.
- `stream_hex`: the exact bytes of a stream with zero or more frames. The expected value is the list of responses. If the step has `read_size`, each read returns a maximum of `read_size` bytes. If the step has `write_size`, each write accepts a maximum of `write_size` bytes. A stream step names its `operation`, so that the runner can check each success result.
- `request` with `pad_to`: the runner adds one unknown field to the envelope or to the body (`pad_to.in`). The field name is `pad_to.key_prefix` followed by padding, so the canonical payload is exactly `pad_to.size` bytes.

The expected response must be equal to the actual response, with these markers:

| Marker | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `{"$capture":"name"}` | expected | A nonempty string. The first use binds the name. A later use must be equal. |
| `{"$use":"name"}` | request | The bound value. |
| `{"$type":"string"}` | expected | Any string. |

The runner also checks that each response frame is in the frame bound. It checks each response against the envelope schema and each success result against the result schema of its operation. It compares the exact payload bytes of each frame with the canonical bytes of its object. Before the sessions, the runner checks its own RFC 8785 encoder on `vectors/jcs.json` and its own schema check on `vectors/envelope-schema.json`.

The Go tests do the checks that need a Host in the process. `schema_test.go` checks that each Host operation has one schema file with the same fields as the Host table. In `protocol/adapter_test.go`, a stub Host with a result over the frame bound must give `response_too_large`. A stub Host that panics, a stub Host that returns a float, and a stub Host that returns a value outside the value domain must each give one `internal_error` frame.

If a session file has an error, the runner keeps its store directory under the work directory and lists it in `kept_stores`. An error record keeps the full exception text and the traceback.

## Go sidecar

The Go sidecar (#84) passes the vector files:

- `test_protocol.py --sidecar <binary> --runtime <cel-handoff>` starts a new sidecar process for each session file, with the `context` of the file and a new store. Each frame step uses a new connection. After the response, the runner sends a probe frame with the version `9.0`. If the connection is open, the probe gets `unsupported_version`. If the connection is closed, the stream ends. Thus the runner sees `close`. A stream step sends the bytes in parts of `read_size` bytes and reads the output in parts of `write_size` bytes.
- The runner also checks that the socket file has mode 0600, that each payload is canonical, and that the sidecar removes its socket file and exits with status 0 after SIGTERM.
- A self-test gives the runner a wrong response, a close that the step does not expect and a close that does not occur. The runner must report all three.
- The Go tests in `src/lifecycle-core/protocol/` run all vector files in the process, with short reads and short writes, and the stub Host checks.

## Limits

- The vectors do not run a rule. `describe` with an activation, `qualify`, `load`, `invoke`, `replay` and `restate` are checked only by their schemas. The [sidecar client](../../examples/sidecar-client/README.md) runs `qualify`, `describe`, `load` and `invoke` through the socket with the pinned runtime, but it is an example, not a vector.
- A record object inside a result (`record`, `receipt`, `report`) must have `format: "entelos.record/1"`. A receipt in the `invoke`, `replay`, `restate` and `receipt` results must also have `stale` (a boolean), `stale_mode` (`fail_closed` or `continue_stale`) and `stale_reason` (`expired`, `revoked` or an empty string), `executor_id` (a nonempty string) and `log_cursor` (an integer). The schemas do not define the other fields of a record. The `state` object has the type `object` only.
- The validator supports only the JSON Schema keywords that the files in `schema/` use.
