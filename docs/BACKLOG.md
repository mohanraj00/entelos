## Milestones to a public announcement

On 2026-10-29, the maintainer chose to announce Entelos as a source reference to read and copy. It is not a library to depend on. A milestone is complete only when its exit test passes. The announcement itself needs specific maintainer authorization.

| Milestone | Work | Exit test |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Bootstrap | Done: runnable reference, two examples, full-suite CI, Apache-2.0, cross-harness review, rename. | Met on 2026-10-29. |
| [M1 First contact](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/10) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-30: issues 3 and 4, one demo command that shows an answer, a correction, a replay and a restatement, a README that states the problem first, one diagram of the complete path. Then a clear first run: issues 44 and 46. | Changed on 2026-10-30. The observed sessions are dropped (see #10). A maintainer run of the demo and an adversarial critic pass replace them. No outside engineer ran the demo. |
| [M2 Comparison](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/11) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-30: compare OPA/Rego, Cedar, GoRules ZEN, feature-flag services and ordinary code plus Git, and state where each one is the better choice. [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) answers three first questions. | Met on 2026-10-30, with the three questions of the critic pass in place of the questions of the M1 engineers. The Cedar blocks were not run. |
| [M3 Copy proof](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/12) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-31: the tier-eligibility example (PR #59) reuses `src/` and needed 0 `src/` changes. It found 9 docs gaps (issue #60). | Met on 2026-10-31. An agent wrote the example from the docs, not an outside engineer. |
| [M4 Contributor path](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/13) | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, three to five starter issues, a review path for a human contributor without an agent harness, CI on Linux and macOS. | One outside pull request merges through the documented path. |
| [M5 Snapshot and announcement](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/14) | A record format version field, a compatibility statement, a changelog, a `v0.1.0` tag, a security review of the approval and record path. A quiet share with five to ten engineers before the public post. | The tag passes on both operating systems. Known limits are at the top of the README. |

A reference to copy needs no package release. A tag gives a stable snapshot that a reader can cite and copy.

No issue here authorizes an unscoped model benchmark, a new domain policy, a public package release or production deployment. Choose the smallest change that completes the issue's stated workflow and preserve its failures/limits.
