## Milestones to a public announcement

On 2026-10-29, the maintainer chose to announce Entelos as a source reference to read and copy. It is not a library to depend on. A milestone is complete only when its exit test passes. The announcement itself needs specific maintainer authorization.

| Milestone | Work | Exit test |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Bootstrap | Done: runnable reference, two examples, full-suite CI, Apache-2.0, cross-harness review, rename. | Met on 2026-10-29. |
| [M1 First contact](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/10) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-30: issues 3 and 4, one demo command that shows an answer, a correction, a replay and a restatement, a README that states the problem first, one diagram of the complete path. Then a clear first run: issues 44 and 46. | Changed on 2026-10-30. The observed sessions are dropped (see #10). A maintainer run of the demo and an adversarial critic pass replace them. No outside engineer ran the demo. |
| [M2 Comparison](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/11) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-30: compare OPA/Rego, Cedar, GoRules ZEN, feature-flag services and ordinary code plus Git, and state where each one is the better choice. [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) answers three first questions. | Met on 2026-10-30, with the three questions of the critic pass in place of the questions of the M1 engineers. The Cedar blocks were not run. |
| [M3 Copy proof](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/12) | Done in `main` on 2026-10-31: the tier-eligibility example (PR #59) reuses `src/` and needed 0 `src/` changes. It found 9 docs gaps (issue #60). | Met on 2026-10-31. An agent wrote the example from the docs, not an outside engineer. |
| [M4 Contributor path](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/13) | Done in `main` on 2026-11-03: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, three to five starter issues, a review path for a human contributor without an agent harness, CI on Linux and macOS. | Met on 2026-11-03: PR #69 from an outside contributor merged through the documented path. |
| [M5 Snapshot and announcement](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/14) | A compatibility statement, a changelog, a `v0.1.0` tag, a security review of the approval and record path. A quiet share with five to ten engineers before the public post. On 2026-11-04, the maintainer moved the record format version field to the design work after v0.1.0. On 2026-11-06, the `v0.2.0` tag marked the M6 snapshot for the quiet share. | The tag passes on both operating systems. Known limits are at the top of the README. |
| [M6 Store-neutral core and versioned protocol](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/77) | Done in `main` on 2026-11-06: a technology decision (#85), a record format version (#78), storage port conformance vectors and an in-memory adapter (#79), a qualification runner interface (#80), receipt provenance and idempotent ingest (#81), a fail-closed expiry mode (#82), a versioned wire protocol (#83), a local sidecar (#84), a Go core (#88), the removal of the Python core (#95) and a browser executor (#93). | Met on 2026-11-06 at `bf51d0e`: `verify.py` passes on both operating systems. Both adapters pass the storage vectors. The sidecar passes the protocol vectors. An example runs the full path through the sidecar only. A repeated ingest adds no records. An expired activation fails closed. The browser executor passes the executor vectors in a headless browser. See #77 for the full test. |

A reference to copy needs no package release. A tag gives a stable snapshot that a reader can cite and copy.

The v0.3.0 announcement candidate targets 2026-12-12. [#14](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/14) tracks the candidate, approval and record review, and release handoff. It depends on sidecar authentication (#125), the copy-proof docs (#60, #62 and #66) and evidence for Claude review (#114). The exit test requires the exact candidate to pass on Linux and macOS with the limits at the top of the README. The tag, quiet share and public post each require owner authorization.

No issue here authorizes an unscoped model benchmark, a new domain policy, a public package release or production deployment. Choose the smallest change that completes the issue's stated workflow and preserve its failures/limits.
