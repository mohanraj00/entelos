# Current work

## Name

The project name is Entelos, with the tagline "Entelos: grow toward the goal." On 2026-10-29, the GitHub repository changed from `mohanraj00/versioned-decision-reference` to `mohanraj00/entelos`. GitHub redirects the old URL. The Go module path and the NOTICE attribution are unchanged. On 2026-10-29, `entelos` was free on PyPI, npm and crates.io, and the .dev and .io domains were free. The GitHub user and the .com, .ai and .org domains were taken. No trademark database was searched.

## Source reference

The source reference contains a primitive typed CEL callable, a local qualified Git lifecycle in Go, record-filter and PR CI examples, and an ordinary-function comparison. APIs and record formats are unstable. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for the tested environment and operating limits.

## Licence

Project source uses [Apache-2.0](../LICENSE); [NOTICE](../NOTICE) retains project attribution. The [licence decision](LICENSING.md) records the maintainer choice and earlier MIT publication. Runtime/example/dependency bytes are unchanged by that change.

## Shared workflow

Purpose is in [CONSTITUTION.md](../CONSTITUTION.md), workflow in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Codex (`AGENTS.md`), Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`) and agy (`GEMINI.md`) share those files and the same skill source. A different harness reviews each change; see [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md). `tools/check_project.py` checks that layout, links and source checksums.

The `CI` workflow checks the project structure and source inventory on every change. For code changes only, its `standalone` job runs `verify.py` on two runners, `ubuntu-24.04` and `macos-15`. Each run uploads its compact results and command logs for 14 days. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for the observed toolchain. Two passing runners do not establish broad platform support.

## Layout

On 2026-10-29, the code moved to `src/` and `examples/`, the boundary test moved to `tests/`, and the loose reference docs moved to `docs/` and `licenses/`. `GEMINI.md` replaced `Agent.md`. Behavior did not change; the full suite must pass on the new paths.

## Next work

Use [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) and the linked GitHub issues. [M6 Store-neutral core and versioned protocol](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/77) met its exit test on 2026-11-06. The maintainer authorized the `v0.2.0` tag on `8ace59c`. The full suite passed on `ubuntu-24.04` and `macos-15` in [CI run 42164134936](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/actions/runs/42164134936) on that commit. This snapshot does not read v0.1.0 stores.

[#14](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/14) tracks the v0.3.0 announcement candidate with a target of 2026-12-12. The candidate needs the sidecar authentication and copy-proof docs, a working Claude review, and a new security review of the Go approval and record path. Verify the exact candidate on Linux and macOS before asking the maintainer to tag it. The tag, quiet share and public post each need specific authorization.

The Go review in [#136](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/136) found SEC-01 (P2): a malformed checkpoint could publish an unreadable root. PR #137 (merge `9db63e8`) fixed it. The Host checks the types of stored request fields, and both stores refuse state that the decoder cannot read. On 2026-11-11, the maintainer authorized the `v0.3.0` tag.

The v0.4 milestone starts with [#126](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/126), typed rule inputs and outputs. The spec [typed-profile-spec.md](../src/cel-lifecycle/typed-profile-spec.md) proposes the profile `cel-typed/v1`, with vectors in [conformance/typed/](../src/cel-lifecycle/conformance/typed/). The spec is in review. No host code implements it, and no harness runs the typed vectors yet.

### v0.4 approval API

On 2026-11-11, a spec for [#130](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/130) was proposed in [APPROVAL.md](../src/protocol/approval/APPROVAL.md). It adds protocol 1.1 with `proposals`, `proposal`, a `reject` disposition for `decide`, a credentials file for each reviewer and a Host clock. The schemas and vectors are hand-written. `check_spec.py` checks their structure and clock arithmetic. No Host runs them yet.

### M1 First contact

On 2026-10-30, the M1 work was complete in `main` (merge commit `e844246`):

- [WALKTHROUGH.md](WALKTHROUGH.md) gives the typed caller and the correction (issue #3).
- [CORRECTION.md](CORRECTION.md) explains a fact correction and a rule restatement (issue #4).
- `examples/quickstart/demo.py` runs the answer, correction, replay and restatement in one command. `verify.py` compares its results with the fixture and checks the failure evidence (issues #15 and #27).
- The README states the problem first and shows the [decision path diagram](diagrams/decision-path.svg) (issues #16 and #17).

On 2026-10-30, the maintainer dropped the observed first-contact sessions as the M1 exit test. The scope of that test was not clear, and most of it measured whether the docs were clear enough to run the demo. The maintainer ran the demo and found those problems in one session. The reason and the limits are on [issue #10](https://github.com/mohanraj00/entelos/issues/10). These changes replace the test:

- PR #45 (merge `0375158`, issue #44): a clear error and a README line for the work directory.
- PR #47 (merge `c3a2ece`, issue #46): a tools table, numbered steps, a demo output that explains each step, a Go and Git check before the build, and an "After the demo" table.
- A fresh-context adversarial critic read the new README. Its findings are on PR #47.

No engineer who does not know the project ran the demo. Nobody recorded whether the problem matters to an engineer. [FIRST_CONTACT.md](FIRST_CONTACT.md) and the first-contact issue form stay in the repo, but nobody used them.

### M2 Comparison

On 2026-10-30, the M2 work was complete in `main`:

- Five pages in [compare/](compare/): OPA/Rego, Cedar, GoRules ZEN, feature-flag services and ordinary code plus Git (issues #33 to #37). Each page states where the other tool is the better choice.
- [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) answers the three questions of the critic pass (PR #48, merge `49d5a7e`, issue #38).

The M2 exit test was "the first three questions from the M1 engineers". The three questions of the critic replace them, because the first-contact sessions did not run.

These parts of M2 were not run:

- The Cedar blocks in [compare/cedar.md](compare/cedar.md) are proposed text from the Cedar docs. Nobody parsed, validated or authorized them.
- Unleash, the GoRules BRMS and the OpenFeature SDK are described from their docs only.
- No call cost, speed or effort was measured.

On 2026-10-31, the five critic findings from PR #47 were complete in `main`:

- An example of how a service calls a rule from its own code (issue #50, PR #56).
- A command that prints a receipt from the demo (issue #51, PR #58).
- The first-screen order: the problem now comes before the Limits note (issue #52, PR #56).
- Progress output from `verify.py` on stderr (issue #53, PR #57).
- Plain definitions in "What the examples show" (issue #54, PR #56).

### M3 Copy proof

On 2026-10-31, the M3 work was complete in `main` (PR #59, merge `f14e2f8`):

- [examples/tier-eligibility/](../examples/tier-eligibility/) adds a third neutral example, `feature.bulk_export`. It reuses `src/` without a copy.
- The example needed 0 `src/` changes. `verify.py` runs it as the `tier-eligibility` check, and the full run had 20 passed checks and 0 failed checks.
- [FINDINGS.md](../examples/tier-eligibility/FINDINGS.md) records 9 docs gaps. For each gap, the author read source to continue. Issue #60 owns the docs for these gaps.
- The [consumer guide](ADD_CONSUMER.md) covers reuse, the record-filter scenario limit and adding an example to the verifier (#66). The [contract map](CONTRACTS.md) covers the author fixture, fixed values, case checks, lifecycle requests, proposal base and content references (#63, #64 and #65). The [CI example README](../examples/ci-trigger/README.md) was added in PR #111, which closed #62.

These are the limits of the M3 result:

- An agent wrote the example from the docs, not an engineer from outside the project.
- The example uses only the current profile: string/bool inputs and a bool output.

### M4 Contributor path

On 2026-11-03, the M4 exit test was met in `main`:

- PR #67 (merge `1339d71`) adds `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates and a review path for a contributor without an agent harness.
- PR #68 (merge `6043da4`) runs `verify.py` on `macos-15` in CI, beside `ubuntu-24.04`.
- PR #69 (merge `718ca52`, issue #64) is the first pull request from an outside contributor. It merged through the documented path.
- PR #70 (merge `9ee54ed`, issue #63) is a second outside pull request.
- PR #72 (merge `5616680`) adds a manual security review for when Codex and agy are both not available.

These are the limits of the M4 result:

- The outside pull requests changed only docs. No outside contributor changed code.
- Starter issues #62, #65 and #66 were open at the M4 exit test. PR #71 later closed #65.

### M6 Store-neutral core and versioned protocol

On 2026-11-05, the maintainer approved the M6 scope in issue #77. Decision [0002](decisions/0002-browser-executor.md) adds a browser executor (#93): the Go executor compiled to WASM, for web delivery with no install. The specs and vectors for #78 to #81 are language-neutral.

On 2026-11-05, the maintainer accepted the [technology decision](decisions/0001-technology.md): Go for the core and the sidecar, JSON with RFC 8785 digests on a Unix socket, and a gomobile executor package for native Swift and Kotlin apps.

Issue #79 adds a storage port spec, 11 JSON storage vectors and an in-memory adapter. The Git adapter and the in-memory adapter pass all vectors. The Go tests run them in the `go-lifecycle-core` check of `verify.py`. The vectors do not show durability or performance.

Issue #78 adds the record format version. Each stored record has `format: "entelos.record/1"`. `View.Get` reads only this major version. A record without a format or with an unknown major version fails closed with `unsupported_record_format`. The `record-format` storage vector and a Host test check this rule. The vector set now has 12 files. Stores from v0.1.0 are not migrated, and there is no migration tool.

Issue #82 adds the fail-closed expiry and revocation mode. Expiry is a date at or after the `until` date of the loaded activation. Revocation is a later mask, usually a `suspend` event. By default, `invoke` then fails closed with `activation_expired` or `activation_revoked`. A proposal can declare `stale_mode` `continue_stale`, so that the reviewer approves the mode with the revision. Then the loaded activation answers, and the receipt has `stale` `true`. A reader finds the stale receipts with `inspect` and `receipt`. Scenario steps show both modes. The Host reads no clock; it compares the invocation date only.

Issue #81 adds receipt provenance and idempotent `ingest` of an executor log. Raw inputs stay with the executor by default. There is no network transport for ingest.

Issue #80 adds the [qualification runner contract](../src/lifecycle-core/RUNNER.md) to the Go core. CEL is the first runner, and a test-only fixture runner shows that runners plug in.

Issue #84 adds the Go sidecar `entelos-sidecar`: wire protocol 1.0 on a Unix socket with mode 0600. It passes all session vectors through the socket (`sidecar-protocol`), and [examples/sidecar-client](../examples/sidecar-client/README.md) completes propose, qualify, decide, activate and invoke through the socket only (`sidecar-client`). There is no authentication beyond the file mode.

Issue #95 removes the Python lifecycle core: the Python Host, its Git and in-memory stores, its JSONL CLI, the protocol reference adapter and the parity tool. The Go core in `src/lifecycle-core` is now the only Host. `scenario_test.go` runs the lifecycle scenario with the fixture values. Each removed Python test has a Go test or a vector with the same expected values. The examples call the Go JSONL host through the Python callers in `src/lifecycle-core/client/`. `src/cel-lifecycle` keeps the specs, the vectors and the fixtures.

Issue #93 (first part) adds the [executor](CONTRACTS.md#executor) to `cel-handoff`. The maintainer amended decision 0002: qualification is for each build, so the WASM module has its own `implementation_ref`. The same command builds for `js/wasm`. In a browser it serves a JavaScript bridge; under Node with arguments it serves the command line. `verify.py` runs 7 executor vector files on the native build, as WASM under Node and through the bridge, and the entries are equal except for the build and bundle identities (`wasm-executor`). The Go lifecycle scenario also passes with the WASM module as the engine (`wasm-qualification`). On macOS arm64 with Go 1.27.2, the module is about 22 MB raw and 4.3 MB with gzip level 9, and the Node cold start was 63 ms. A browser cold start is unmeasured. The IndexedDB receipt log, the headless browser run and the ingest of a browser log are not done yet.

Issue #93 (second part) adds `web/entelos-executor.mjs`: a module integrity check before the module runs, and a receipt log in IndexedDB. `verify.py` runs the executor vectors in headless Chromium, and the entries are equal to the native entries except for the build and bundle identities (`browser-executor-vectors`). [examples/browser-executor](../examples/browser-executor/) runs the complete path: the Host qualifies with the WASM module, the browser answers from a pin of Host records and keeps its log, and the Host ingests that log once (`browser-executor-ingest`). In headless Chrome 156 on macOS arm64, a local fetch of the module took 14 ms and 29 ms, and the start (compile, instantiate and bridge ready) took 109 ms and 131 ms in two page loads. These numbers are for one machine and a local server. They are not a general speed claim.

On 2026-11-06, M6 met its exit test at commit `bf51d0e`. `verify.py` passes on `ubuntu-24.04` and `macos-15`. The ingest item uses the browser executor, not a simulated executor. The `sidecar-client` example does not ingest.

After that exit test, ingest compares the response `implementation_ref` with the snapshot `engine_build`, and a different build gives `artifact_mismatch`. A Go test also plants records with an unknown format in a Git store and reads them through a real Unix socket with the sidecar server code. That test does not run the `entelos-sidecar` binary, and the protocol vectors cannot make such a record.

Issue #125 adds a token check before each request on the sidecar socket. The server reads the operator's token file for each check, so token rotation applies to open connections. A denial reaches neither the request parser nor the Host. The JSON message version remains 1.0.

Keep caller walkthrough and input-correction documentation bounded to the existing examples. Numeric/structured profiles, production DBs, authentication gateways and resident-worker coordination are outside the current implemented scope.

## Handoff rule

Record the selected issue, final commit, behavior/checks and unresolved limits. A future worker must be able to identify the next task without reconstructing a conversation. Preserve meaningful failures and mark unmeasured claims as unmeasured.
