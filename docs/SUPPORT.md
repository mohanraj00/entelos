# Support scope

I maintain this as a source reference and a Go dependency, not a hosted product or package-registry release. [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) names the stable surfaces. There is no support SLA or promised upgrade schedule.

The supported work is reproducing the supplied examples, fixing defects in documented contract/lifecycle behavior and reviewing dependency-pin updates with the same checks. Report a small neutral reproducer, source revision, tool versions and expected/actual behavior. Real customer data, credentials and confidential source material do not belong in reports.

## Compatibility and retention

The reviewed local run uses Go 1.27.2, Python 3.14.6 and Git 2.54.0 on macOS arm64. The `standalone` job of the `CI` GitHub Actions workflow runs the same verifier on the `ubuntu-24.04` runner (x86_64) with Go 1.27.2, Python 3.14.6 and the runner's Git (2.56.0 in the first run). The same job also runs `verify.py` on the `macos-15` runner (arm64) with the same Go and Python versions and the runner's Git. Other toolchain/OS combinations have not been tested. The concurrency test requires POSIX fork; Windows is outside this reference's tested scope. The browser checks need a Chromium browser. `ENTELOS_BROWSER` names it, and CI uses the Chrome of the runner image. The sidecar is POSIX only. These runners are not a cross-platform support claim.

CEL Go is pinned to v0.32.0 and the author CLI source to commit 5eac36c53cd8971fa1e5548374238183e0d8b302. The module lockfiles select the dependency closure. A pin or runtime-source change requires new build identity, fresh qualification and the relevant checks. Keep the old build/inputs/artifacts for exact replay. The Git store does not archive executable toolchains for you.

[STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md) is the compatibility statement for the Go packages, the wire protocol and the record format. It names the stable surfaces and the experimental surfaces, the promise for 0.x releases and the deprecation path. A surface that the stability pin does not check can change in any release. Content hashes are not signatures or source authority.

Each stored record has a `format` field. The current value is `entelos.record/1`. The number after the slash is the major version. A reader reads only the major version that it knows. If a record has no `format` field or an unknown major version, the read fails closed with the diagnostic `unsupported_record_format`. If the `format` value has a different shape, the read fails with `invalid_record`. The storage port spec and the `record-format` storage vector define this rule.

v0.2.0 and v0.3.0 use the same record major. Record readability and execution compatibility are separate. A new lifecycle or engine build needs fresh qualification and approval before activation and load. For exact replay of an earlier receipt, retain the lifecycle and engine builds that the receipt names, along with its inputs and bundle. A retry of a stored write requires current access to the affected functions.

Stores from v0.1.0 are not migrated. The v0.1.0 snapshot declared the records unstable, and its records have no `format` field. The current code does not read them; each read of such a record gives `unsupported_record_format`. There is no migration tool. To keep a v0.1.0 store readable, keep the v0.1.0 code and build with it. Compatibility replay across record formats needs its own explicit design and tests.

## Operating limits

The implementation is for modest local histories and trusted host adapters. Each receipt commits through the same root. Successful-request recovery searches first-parent history. Neither operation is a high-volume service design. Backups, retention, filesystem durability, sensitive-data access and cleanup of unreachable objects are operator responsibilities.

Fault injection checks process-level publication and lost replies. It does not establish power-loss durability, consensus across clones or production DB portability. Worker state is a preparation acknowledgement, not live deployment health. Tasks have manual claims/checkpoints/fences, without lease expiry or a scheduler. Activation expiry compares the invocation date with the activation interval. The Host reads no clock, and there is no clock synchronization policy beyond the local clock of the executor that sets the date. A full numeric allowance model, structured wire types, custom capabilities, a production DB, remote synchronization and automatic learning are outside the maintained example scope.

For a contribution, keep it tied to a concrete workflow and state what is tested. An adapter is not supported merely because it implements a similarly named method. New guarantees require independent expectations and relevant conformance checks.
